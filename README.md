<p>Learened on how to implement Bootstrap into a project. Also, on how to incorporate Jquery into a proeject. Also, learned a lot about design and placement. If I had more time for the project I think I would of made it more streamlined. A problem that I discovered was trying to make the website too busy. Simple is better</p>
