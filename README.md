<h2>Website for cash offer website</h2>
<p>Website I built with Bootstrap, Jquery, and Html</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Website that is designed for a company to use to help users input their information into the website so that the company can hopefully buy their properties from them.</p> 
<h3>Cool Features</h3>
<p>Boostrap, SCSS, and Jquery</p>
<h3>Things I learned</h3>
<p>Learned on how to implement Bootstrap and Jquery into a project. Also, learned a lot about design and placement. If I had more time for the project; I think I would of made it more streamlined. A problem that I discovered was trying to make the website too busy. Simple is better</p>
